## Semantic Answer Similarity
For the evaluation of semantic answer similarity metrics as opposed to lexical-based metrics, we compiled three datasets of pairs of answers to the same question that we labeled with regard to the semantic similarity of the answers. It comprises 3,659 annotated answer pairs in NQ_open_SAS.csv, 943 pairs in SQuAD_SAS.csv, and 433 pairs in GermanQuAD_SAS.csv.
